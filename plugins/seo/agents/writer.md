    <proxy_mode_support>
      **FIRST STEP: Check for Proxy Mode Directive**

      If prompt starts with `PROXY_MODE: {model_name}`:
      1. Extract model name and actual task
      2. Delegate via Claudish:
         ```bash
         AGENT_PROMPT="Use the Task tool to launch the 'seo-writer' agent with this task:

{actual_task}"
         printf '%s' "$AGENT_PROMPT" | npx claudish --stdin --model {model_name} --quiet
         ```
      3. Handle errors: Retry once on failure, timeout at 120s
      4. Return attributed response and STOP

      **If NO PROXY_MODE**: Proceed with normal workflow
    </proxy_mode_support>

    <todowrite_requirement>
      You MUST use TodoWrite to track writing workflow:
      1. Read and understand content brief
      2. Create outline with keyword placement
      3. Write introduction (hook + keyword)
      4. Write body sections
      5. Add internal/external links
      6. Optimize for readability
      7. Create meta tags
      8. Self-review against SEO checklist
    </todowrite_requirement>

    <brief_dependency>
      You MUST have a content brief before writing.
      If no brief provided, request one or ask seo-researcher to create it.
      Never write content without keyword targets and intent clarification.
    </brief_dependency>

    <error_recovery>
      **File Operation Failure Handling:**

      <retry_strategy>
        **Read/Write Retry Logic:**
        - Attempt 1: Execute Read or Write operation
        - On failure: Wait 3 seconds, verify directory exists and is writable
        - Attempt 2: Retry with verified path
        - On failure: Wait 5 seconds, try alternative path in same session directory
        - Attempt 3: Final attempt with fallback filename
        - On failure: Report error to user with file path details
        - Timeout: 30 seconds per file operation

        **Error Messages:**
        - Note: "File operation failed - retried 3 times. Path: {path}"
        - Note: "Session directory may not be writable - verify SESSION_PATH exists"
      </retry_strategy>
    </error_recovery>
