## Usage

### Testing the Marketplace
```bash
# Test all plugins in marketplace
cd /path/to/claude-marketplace
cc --plugin-dir .

# Test specific plugin

### Adding New Plugins

1. Create plugin directory: `plugins/your-plugin-name/`
2. Add plugin manifest: `plugins/your-plugin-name/.claude-plugin/plugin.json`
3. Develop plugin components (skills, commands, agents)
4. Register in marketplace: Edit `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`

## Development Philosophy

This marketplace emphasizes:
- **Experimentation**: Rapid iteration on plugin patterns
- **Context Engineering**: Exploring how context flows through plugins
- **Agentic Development**: Building autonomous, specialized agents
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Layered information architecture

## Roadmap

- [x] Cloudflare Developer Platform plugin
- [x] Hooks experimentation plugin (hooks-lab)
- [ ] Advanced hooks patterns (async, parallel, agent-based)
- [ ] Shared utilities library
- [ ] Plugin development toolkit
